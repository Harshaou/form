      <p className='p'>
        Your life has been an inspiration to me. I tried to follow you. I tried to copy you. To summarize,
        I was a fan of you. And I'm still. I've never seen someone as smart as you in my life. I think it
        would be a mistake if I didn't ask you this in the first place before searching for anyone. <br/> <br/>
        I know building a product is not an easy thing. Especially a product like this. I only have 1% of hope.
         But letâ€™s give a hard try.  If you think the same and you excited to be involved to solving this problem.
        Please fill this form.
